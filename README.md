# 🌟 Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer: Explore Algorithms in Action!
Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer—a dynamic, interactive tool that brings algorithms to life! Whether you're a student learning graph theory, a developer curious about React, or just someone who loves watching algorithms paint paths, this project lets you see how Dijkstra, A*, BFS, DFS, and more navigate complex grids.


## 👥 Development Team

| Name         | Student ID | Contribution                          |
|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Le Hung | ITCSIU22   | Team leader: Double check code and algorithm <br> Data Structure: Recursive Division <br> Algorithms: A-Star, Dijkstra  |
| Tran Dang Nhat   | ITITIU22115   | Data Structure: Binary tree <br> Algorithms: DFS, BFS |

## 🚀 What’s Inside?
### Pathfinding Algorithms:
- ▶️ Dijkstra (guaranteed shortest path)
- ▶️ A* (smart heuristic search)
- ▶️ BFS (radial "level-by-level" exploration)
- ▶️ DFS (deep, meandering paths)

### Maze Generators:
- 🧩 Recursive Division: Maze-like partitions with walls.
- 🌳 Binary Tree: Quirky, bias-driven mazes.

### Features You’ll Love:
- 🖱️ Drag to Draw Walls: Customize your own labyrinth!
- ⏩ Adjustable Speeds: Slow-mo or lightning-fast—your choice.
- 🎨 Color-Coded Clarity: Watch nodes light up as they’re visited, traversed, or turned into paths.

## ✨ Why This Project?
- Learn Visually: Algorithms feel abstract until you watch them work.
- Experiment Freely: Tweak settings, compare strategies, and see trade-offs in real time.
- Built with Modern Tech: React + TypeScript for clean code, Tailwind CSS for sleek design.
